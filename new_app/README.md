# Stateless widget changing states with Providers

- `Yes!` The stateless widgets can change their states by using the Power of Providers.

- For this purpose we use `ValueNotifiers` and `ValueListenableBuilders` with each other.

- Although this is not very cool as we cannot use the dispose method and other functionalities provided by the stateful widgets.
